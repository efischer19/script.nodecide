# Sitcoms And Chill

## A Kodi plugin for my home media center.

I'm throwing this together really quicky as a weekend hack with one goal - I want to be able to push a single button (on an Amazon Dash) to begin playing sitcom episodes randomly chosen from a curated list, so I don't have to think about choosing what to watch anymore. With some luck, it'll be developed to the point of allowing a second button push during playback to mean "skip this episode".

Minimal documentation and/or testing, this is mostly a weekend hack for myself at this point.
